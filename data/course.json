  "course_description": "This open-access conversation exchange site offers topics and conversation tasks for students learning Russian and English. The goal of this pilot project is to support exchanges between students in English-speaking and Russian-speaking countries.\u00a0\n\nThe conversation topics included are aligned with common college-level Russian language curricula, grouped by levels defined by [ACTFL proficiency standards,](https://www.actfl.org/educator-resources/actfl-proficiency-guidelines) and utilize [OPI (Oral Proficiency Interview)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.actfl.org%2Fassessment-research-and-development%2Factfl-assessments%2Factfl-postsecondary-assessments%2Foral-proficiency-interview-opi&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw05z0FmOdGnG_aPpL0kTFix) practices. Topics include vocabulary, questions, and interactive activities that can be used in conversations as well as in individual practice.\n\n[Maria Khotimsky](https://languages.mit.edu/people/maria-khotimsky/) (MIT) initiated this project based on [conversation exchanges](https://languages.mit.edu/creating-connections-in-times-of-isolation-mit-skoltech-conversation-exchanges/) between SkolTech and MIT students, in collaboration with Dr. Marina Alexandrova (UT Austin) and Iringa Kogel (Davidson College).\n\nThe \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b website is published under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA) International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.",
